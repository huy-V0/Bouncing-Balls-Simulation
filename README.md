# Bouncing balls simulation
This program simulates bouncing balls inside a circle with a spinning arc sector, where balls interact based on their position relative to the arc. The motion and collisions are implemted by principles of circular motion and tangential velocity. 
Applying geometry and physics algorithms for precise reflections.

# Instructions
Pygame and Python3 are required.
From cmd/PowerShell:
```javascript
python main.py
```
